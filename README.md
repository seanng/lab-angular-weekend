# Lab: Angular Weekend

Are you ready to do some AngularJS coding this weekend?

Let's get yourself familiar with Angular by revisiting two old friends: [Shopping Cart](https://github.com/wdi-hk-10/lab-shopping-cart) and [Ten-Seconds Math](https://github.com/wdi-hk-10/lab-ten-seconds-math).

## Task 0 - Fork and Clone

  1. Fork and clone this repo to your account.
  2. You should write your code in the 2 folders from your forked repo: [shopping-cart](shopping-cart) and [ten-seconds-math](ten-seconds-math). 

## Task 1 - Shopping Cart

  1. Go to the folder `shopping-cart`
  2. Run `bower install --save`
  3. Happy Coding!

## Task 2 - Ten-Seconds Math

  1. Go to the folder by `ten-seconds-math`
  2. Run `bower install --save`
  3. Happy Coding!

## Rules

  1. **DO NOT** use any jQuery code.
  2. You are welcome to check out the jQuery solutions from the old repos.
